### Welcome to Part 1 of the tutorial series on basic exploratory data science! 

For this tutorial, navigate to the /notebooks/ folder and open up the file <u>EDA_tut01.ipynb</u>. 

In this course, you'll be working primarily with <strong>Jupyter Notebooks</strong>, a type of interactive Python simulations where you'll be able to easily manipulate, visualize, and model data.

### <strong>EDA: Mobile App Data</strong>

In this tutorial, we'll start you off with a nod towards our mobile developers and roots as a mobile game academy by exploring a <strong>curated dataset on over 10k mobile apps</strong> on the app store. 

Consider the following questions as you work through the tutorial:
- What's the average byte size of mobile apps?
- How many apps are free vs. paid?
- How many mobile apps are games and what is the general categorical distribution of apps by genre?
- What are the most popular mobile games by total popular rating?

As you complete the tutorial, write down answers you find to these questions and be sure to ask your own! 

A strong part of data science is being able to formulate critical questions based off of observations you see in unknown data.
